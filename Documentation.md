# Independent Study Winter/Spring 2020

## Proposal: 
People who donate to Think Outside the Bag NY will receive a tshirt upon donation. Donors will feel a personal connection to the brand by receiving “free” merchandise for a cause they support. The shirt will be aesthetically pleasing on the front, and informative on the back directing to the website. 
<br>
<br>
Donors will be aware of the fact that the process of shipping items is not eco friendly. Donors will be incentivized to recycle the box the shirt game in as a gardening pot. The box for the merchandise will be designed to be eco friendly and biodegradable. The box design will act as a pot for dirt and flowers and will biodegrade in 3 months. 
<br>
<br>
Each box will come with a bag of seeds for planting. It will also come with instructional directions to successfully recycle the box.

## Research
Shipping is the lifeblood of the global economy and 90 percent of trade

<br>
They also create between 2 and 3 percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming and extreme weather effects.

Mr Corbett has calculated that 200 of the largest ships produce as much sulphur as all the world’s cars. The International Council on Clean Transportation found that while road vehicles make up 64 per cent of transport-attributable pollution-related deaths, ships out at sea still account for 16 per cent.

Low-sulphur marine fuels will still account for ~250k deaths and ~6.4 M childhood asthma cases annually, and more stringent standards beyond 2020 may provide additional health benefits. Lower sulphur fuels also reduce radiative cooling from ship aerosols by ~80%, equating to a ~3% increase in current estimates of total anthropogenic forcing. Therefore, stronger international shipping policies may need to achieve climate and health targets by jointly reducing greenhouse gases and air pollution.
